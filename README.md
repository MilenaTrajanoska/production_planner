# Production Planner 

Production Planner is an ASP .NET Core Web application designed to aid production managers by recording logistic and performance metrics, and vizualizing logistic operating curves, work content distributions, throughput distributions and reliability curves.

## Prototype 
The initial prototype of the system can be found on the following link: https://app.mockplus.com/run/rp/HBTckWyy-kEw/rKKjPXs_X?ps=1&ha=0&la=0&fc=0&out=0

It was designed using the Mockplus tool for UI/UX inital designs.

## Metrics and Vizualizations
### Dashboard
The landing page of the appliacation represents a dashboard of commonly utilized metrics in the prooduction management.
